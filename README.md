# Astronomy_Club_Website
🌌 Astronomy Club Website Project 🚀✨ A mock website 🌠 for my college's Astronomy Club 🪐. Features a responsive design 📱 with placeholder sections for events 🗓️, resources 📚, and a gallery 🖼️. Built using HTML 🧑‍💻, CSS 🎨, and JavaScript ⚙️ to sharpen web dev skills. Not for live 🌍, just a learning project 🌟.
